Dr Can Wang has been a Senior Lecturer of Computer Science at Griffith University, Australia since January 2020. Before that, she had been appointed as a Lecturer at Griffith University, Australia since May 2017. Prior to this, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Data61, CSIRO, Australia from 2014 to 2016. She received her PhD degree in Computer Science from University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia in 2013, Master's degree and Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University, China in 2009 and 2007, respectively. Her research work focuses on designing the underlying models and algorithms for those heterogeneous and interdependent behavioural data to make predictions and recommendations, as well as develop software prototypes. Her research aims at proposing new frameworks and theories to data mining and machine learning, as well as applying AI and big data analytics to multidisciplinary domains, including social media, tourism, drug discovery, hospital admission, and medical mining. The impact of her research has been reflected in her high-quality 70+ publications (most of which are with high impact factors and rankings) with real applications and deployments, and the active engagement of research funding.
