abstract: "In drug discovery, determining the binding affinity and functional effects of small-molecule ligands on proteins is critical. Current computational methods can predict these protein-ligand interaction properties but often lose accuracy without high-resolution protein structures and falter in predicting functional effects. We introduce PSICHIC (PhySIcoCHemICal graph neural network), a framework uniquely incorporating physicochemical constraints to decode interaction fingerprints directly from sequence data alone. This enables PSICHIC to attain first-of-its-kind emergent capabilities in deciphering mechanisms underlying protein-ligand interactions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretability. Trained on identical protein-ligand pairs without structural data, PSICHIC matched and even surpassed leading structure-based methods in binding affinity prediction. In a library screening for adenosine A1 receptor agonists, PSICHIC discerned functional effects effectively, ranking the sole novel agonist within the top three. PSICHICâ€™s interpretable fingerprints identified protein residues and ligand atoms involved in interactions. We foresee PSICHIC reshaping virtual screening and deepening our understanding of protein-ligand interactions."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "**[Nature Machine Intelligence, 2024]** This paper introduces PSICHIC, a graph neural network framework that leverages physicochemical constraints to predict protein-ligand interactions directly from sequence data. PSICHIC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in binding affinity prediction, even surpassing existing structure-based methods in certain cases. Furthermore, its interpretable fingerprints illuminate the specific protein residues and ligand atoms involved in these interactions, offering a promising tool for virtual screening and enhancing our understanding of protein-ligand mechanisms."
