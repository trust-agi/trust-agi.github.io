abstract: "Energy consumption is an essential indicator for conserving energy and reducing emissions in industrial manufacturing processes. However, the industrial production chain is a multi-variable, time-varying, nonlinear system, which poses significant challenges for energy consumption prediction, particularly under complex physical–chemical processes, even when the system is in a steady state. Furthermore, the poor accuracy cannot meet practical production requirements due to current prediction systems cannot integrate spatial–temporal information effectively. To solve this issue, this research provides a novel technique for final online goods quality prediction based on deep spatial–temporal graph neural networks (GNN). Our approach can capture hidden spatial information relationships and manage long-time sequences in the processing data by using a learnable dependency matrix and a stacked dilated convolution component. Moreover, these two primary components are organically merged into a single end-to-end optimization framework. The experimental results on the real-world test dataset demonstrate that our technique outperforms rival machine learning techniques. Our research exemplifies how graph deep learning architecture may be utilized to solve real-world problems in industries."
