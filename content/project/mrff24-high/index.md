**Grant:** MRFF - High-Cost Gene Treatments and Digital Health Interventions (2023-2025)

**Investigators:** V Slavin, E Callender, A Carter, F da Silva Costa, H Dahlen, D Ellwood, J Fenwick, V Flanady, A Judge, **AWC Liew**, J Sandall, D Shanley, B Thilaganathan, J Toohill, R Ware 

**Description:**
Each year in Australia more than 9,000 pregnancies are impacted by pre-eclampsia, 27,000 babies are born preterm, and 2,200 babies are tragically stillborn. These outcomes have immediate and lifelong health implications, and many are both preventable and are more common in women from socially disadvantaged groups. This project will lead Australian maternity services into the digital healthcare age. The Tommy’s Clinical Decision Tool (Tommy’s Tool) is an AI based digital clinical decision tool that greatly improves maternal and perinatal health outcomes by synthesising the best evidence to accurately assess a woman’s chance of developing key pregnancy complications and optimally coordinate her care.

**Amount:** $738K
