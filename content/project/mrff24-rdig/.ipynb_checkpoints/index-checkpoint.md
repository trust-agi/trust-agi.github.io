**Grant:** NHMRC Ideas Grant (2023-2026)

**Investigators:** J Mak, **AWC Liew**

**Description:**
HIV synapse is a covert process that enable HIV cell-cell transmission to overcome anti-retroviral therapeutics and broadly neutralising antibodies, hindering the prospect of achieving HIV cure. Our recent paradigm-shift discovery links the transient intracellular calcium (Ca2+) regulation being the key for polarised targeting of HIV assembly machinery during synapse formation. By utilizing the power of modern AI and live cell imaging, this project will develop automated live cell image analysis pipeline to reveal the spatial-temporal dynamics of Ca2+-HIV synapse biology.

**Amount:** $1.2M
