**Grant:** MRFF - Research Data Infrastructure Grant (2023-2026)

**Investigators:** C Carty, L Modenese, E Passmore, O Tirosh, J Walsh, E Rutz, M Schwartz, T Besier, **AWC Liew**, L Dwan, R Boyd, P Thomason, S Leishman, B Patritti, A Murphy: 

**Description:**
Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability in childhood that affects 19.5M people worldwide. This project will develop the data infrastructure to harmonise and link large existing clinical datasets across multiple public hospitals in Australia. This project will also implement novel physics-based AI modelling methods that can be used to predict the outcome of surgical intervention in a virtual environment. The infrastructure developed will be used to address unresolved clinical questions that cannot be addressed with standard clinical research methodologies and produce important evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the surgical treatment of individuals with CP in Australia and abroad. 

**Amount:** $2.5M
